> Note: This project is a work in progress and not yet ready for production use.

This project is an Airbnb clone, where users can search for and book rental properties.

## Project Features

-   **Property Details:** Users can view detailed information about each property, including photos, descriptions, reviews, and availability calendar.

-   **Favorites:** Users can add rental properties to a list of favorites for easy access later. The list is saved to the user's account and can be managed by the user.
-   **Messaging:** Users can send messages to the property owner through the website for any questions or concerns regarding the rental property.
