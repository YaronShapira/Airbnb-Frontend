# Airbnb Clone

This project is an Airbnb clone, where users can search for and book rental properties.

## Project Features

-   **Search:** Users can search for rental properties based on location and dates. The search feature provides a list of matching properties along with filters to narrow down the results based on preferences.
-   **Property Details:** Users can view detailed information about each property, including photos, descriptions, reviews, and availability calendar.
-   **Booking:** Users can book rental properties directly through the website by selecting available dates and submitting payment information. The website then sends a confirmation email to the user and the property owner.
-   **Favorites:** Users can add rental properties to a list of favorites for easy access later. The list is saved to the user's account and can be managed by the user.
-   **Messaging:** Users can send messages to the property owner through the website for any questions or concerns regarding the rental property.
